				<h1>About Static</h1>
				<p>Static is a figment of your imagination. It looks like a living, breathing website based on a CMS, but in reality it is only a static page that has been installed as a Wordpress theme. You will find addresses that lead to undetermined locations, links that have no destinations, images that are not where they appear to be. You're traveling through another dimension&mdash;a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. That's a signpost up ahead: your next stop: the Twilight Zone!</p>
				<p>Just kidding. Seriously, it's only a practice theme... ;)</p>
				<p class="twist">(...Or is it? <em>Muahahahaha</em>........)</p>
